    "The dataset was created in the following phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Phase 1: Data loading and standardization\n",
    "* Loaded two crime datasets: new_reports.csv (new/recent data) and old_reports.csv (historical data)\n",
    "* Standardized column names between both datasets (e.g., Category → Incident Category, PdDistrict → Police District)\n",
    "* Converted data types and extracts missing information (e.g., year from dates)\n",
    "* Cleaned data by removing NaN values and filtering out incomplete years (2026)\n",
    "* Converted all text to uppercase for consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "Phase 2: Category analysis & mapping\n",
    "* Identified unique crime categories in both datasets (comparing ~30+ categories)\n",
    "* Performed category matching analysis between new and old datasets\n",
    "* Made decisions on which categories to standardize (e.g., DRUG/NARCOTIC → DRUG OFFENSE, WARRANTS → WARRANT)\n",
    "* Documented 15 core crime categories with high confidence matches, excluding vague/administrative categories - We used Copilot here to analyse based on crime information online.\n",
    "\n",
    "Phase 3: Dataset merging\n",
    "* Checked for data overlap (removed the 2018 data from one of the datasets)\n",
    "* Concatenated the two datasets into a single merged dataset\n",
    "* Removed exact duplicates based on date, time, category, location\n",
    "\n",
    "Phase 3: Visualisation\n",
    "* Created yearly trend plots for the 15 crime categories (2003-2025)\n",
    "* Generated category plots\n",
    "\n",
    "Phase 4: Final filtering\n",
    "* Based on the plots we removed the categories that showed a big jump / any unusual trend in the transition period between 2017 and 2019, keeping only 10 categories in the final dataset: ARSON, DRUG OFFENSE, EMBEZZLEMENT, GAMBLING, LIQUOR LAWS, MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT, ROBBERY, STOLEN PROPERTY, SUICIDE, WARRANT."
